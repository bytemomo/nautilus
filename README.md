Im making a network assessment tool called ORCA. The idea is this, its an orchestrator and it manages the life cycle of the application: - Scan the hosts and their ports - Use against the findings a campaign ( a set of assessment tests, tls check, tls version check. mitm vulns, fuzzing , etc...) - get the results - gives back the results to the user The tool is intended for IoT protocols (MQTT, EtherCAT, CoAP, ... etc) but i would like it to be protocol agnostic. I would like the campaign's tests to be implemented as plugin style method (like dll or lib or grpc) but tell me what you think. The tool should be written in go (as later on it should support the docker sdk). Also i would like make the lifecycle to be made of this steps: - scanner - classifier (map services -> campaigns steps) - assessor (job executor , concurrency&timeouts) - reporter (aggregate findings write reports) - the campaigns should be in yaml - plugins via gRPC - results are nice in json Give me an architecture done using the clean architecture principle. The plugins are completely transparent to ORCA, ORCA gives only the target:host tuple if the plugins tags matches the one given by the classifier for that specific tuple. The cycle is done like this: - Scan -> gives host:port list - Classifier -> gives tags for each host:port - Runner -> run the plugins (for now one at the time) and saves results - Reporter -> gives back results
