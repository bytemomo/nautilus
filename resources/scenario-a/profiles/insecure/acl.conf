# INSECURE PROFILE - ACL Configuration
#
# This ACL file is intentionally permissive for testing.
# In the insecure profile, this file is NOT loaded by mosquitto.conf
# (the acl_file directive is commented out).
#
# If loaded, it still grants full access to everyone.

# Allow ALL users (including anonymous) to read and write to ALL topics
topic readwrite #

# Allow everyone to read $SYS topics (system information disclosure)
topic read $SYS/#

# Pattern-based wildcard - matches everything for all users
pattern readwrite #
