# Mosquitto Password File for Scenario A
#
# IMPORTANT: This file contains plaintext passwords for testing purposes.
# In production, use: mosquitto_passwd -b passwd <username> <password>
#
# For this test environment, we use plaintext passwords which Mosquitto 
# will accept when password_file is configured.
#
# To generate proper hashed passwords, run inside the broker container:
#   mosquitto_passwd -c /mosquitto/config/passwd admin
#   mosquitto_passwd -b /mosquitto/config/passwd scada scada123
#   etc.
#
# Test Credentials:
#   admin:admin123
#   scada:scada123
#   plc:plc123
#   rtu:rtu123
#   operator:operator
#   guest:guest

admin:admin123
scada:scada123
plc:plc123
rtu:rtu123
operator:operator
